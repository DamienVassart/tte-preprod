An event publishing and booking web platform. This is a personal project intended to be used for demonstration purposes and will be the subject of videos on YouTube.

The diagrams were made using [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/). The original `.drawio` files can be opened with this software. `.PDF` versions are also available.
